# To do list:
- color regular expressions
- Globals and locals
    - Currently defined as "class"
    - Should the outer symbol be colored?
    - Should they be colored in strings?
- how should prefixes be colored? 
    - Should prefixes only be colored at the beginning of the line? I.e. \n\s*[prefix]. Mauricio uses "capture" as an option to some of his functions
- What are limits on function names? Use in program drop ... block.
- Color general commands
    - In something like "label var ..." what should be colored?
- Why is TODO colored... everwhere?
    - It's colored in .md, .do, and .py files... only upper case
- Python colors brackets and parentheses sometimes but not other times...
    - See screenshot to see how python does it.
    - Colors them when part of a function call
- types probably shouldn't be colored the same as macros
- Maybe look in material ui syntax package to see all the names that they give a color to
- What about stuff like "merge ... using". should using be colored?
