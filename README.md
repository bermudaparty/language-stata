# language-stata package
Stata syntax highlighting, built from the ground up

# Features

This package highlights:
- System commands, functions, and function arguments
- Macros, both global and local
- Regular expressions

Other nice features:
- Autocomplete for built-in commands and functions, and for macros as you write them.
- Alerts you if your variable name is illegal, i.e. if your variable name is more than 32 chars, starts with a number, or is a reserved name.
- Support for programming ligatures for all valid Stata syntax for fonts that support them, like the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font.
- Local macro back tick autocompletion. When you write a `, atom automatically fills in a ' after your cursor
