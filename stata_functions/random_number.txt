    [D] functions -- Functions


Description

    This is a quick reference on functions for generating pseudorandom variates.  For help on all
    functions, see [D] functions.  See [R] set seed for setting the random-number seed.


Random-number functions

    runiform()
       Range:        0 to nearly 1 (0 to 1 - 2^(-32))
       Description:  returns uniform random variates.

                     runiform() returns uniformly distributed random variates on the interval [0,1).
                     runiform() takes no arguments, but the parentheses must be typed.  runiform() can
                     be seeded with the set seed command. (See matrix functions for the related
                     matuniform() matrix function.)

                     To generate random variates over the interval [a,b), use a+(b-a)*runiform().

                     To generate random integers over [a,b], use a+int((b-a+1)*runiform()).

    rbeta(a, b)
       Domain a:     0.05 to 1e+5
       Domain b:     0.15 to 1e+5
       Range:        0 to 1 (exclusive)
       Description:  returns beta(a,b) random variates, where a and b are the beta distribution shape
                     parameters.

                     Besides the standard methodology for generating random variates from a given
                     distribution, rbeta() uses the specialized algorithms of Johnk (Gentle 2003),
                     Atkinson and Wittaker (1970, 1976), Devroye (1986), and Schmeiser and Babu (1980).

    rbinomial(n, p)
       Domain n:     1 to 1e+11
       Domain p:     1e-8 to 1-1e-8
       Range:        0 to n
       Description:  returns binomial(n,p) random variates, where n is the number of trials and p is the
                     success probability.

                     Besides the standard methodology for generating random variates from a given
                     distribution, rbinomial() uses the specialized algorithms of Kachitvichyanukul
                     (1982), Kachitvichyanukul and Schmeiser (1988), and Kemp (1986).

    rchi2(df)
       Domain df:    2e-4 to 2e+8
       Range:        0 to c(maxdouble)
       Description:  returns chi-squared, with df degrees of freedom, random variates.

    rgamma(a, b)
       Domain a:     1e-4 to 1e+8
       Domain b:     c(smallestdouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Range:        0 to c(maxdouble)
       Description:  returns gamma(a,b) random variates, where a is the gamma shape parameter and b is
                     the scale parameter.

                     Methods for generating gamma variates are taken from Ahrens and Dieter (1974), Best
                     (1983), and Schmeiser and Lal (1980).

    rhypergeometric(N, K, n)
       Domain N:     2 to 1e+6
       Domain K:     1 to N-1
       Domain n:     1 to N-1
       Range:        max(0,n-N+K) to min(K,n)
       Description:  returns hypergeometric random variates.  The distribution parameters are integer
                     valued, where N is the population size, K is the number of elements in the
                     population that have the attribute of interest, and n is the sample size.

                     Besides the standard methodology for generating random variates from a given
                     distribution, rhypergeometric() uses the specialized algorithms of
                     Kachitvichyanukul (1982) and Kachitvichyanukul and Schmeiser (1985).

    rnbinomial(n, p)
       Domain n:     0.1 to 1e+5
       Domain p:     1e-4 to 1-1e-4
       Range:        0 to 2^53-1
       Description:  returns negative binomial random variates.  If n is integer valued, rnbinomial()
                     returns the number of failures before the nth success, where the probability of
                     success on a single trial is p.  n can also be nonintegral.

    rnormal()
       Range:        c(mindouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Description:  returns standard normal (Gaussian) random variates, that is, variates from a normal
                     distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

    rnormal(m)
       Domain m:     c(mindouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Range:        c(mindouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Description:  returns normal(m,1) (Gaussian) random variates, where m is the mean and the
                     standard deviation is 1.

    rnormal(m, s)
       Domain m:     c(mindouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Domain s:     c(smallestdouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Range:        c(mindouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Description:  returns normal(m,s) (Gaussian) random variates, where m is the mean and s is the
                     standard deviation.

                     The methods for generating normal (Gaussian) random variates are taken from Knuth
                     (1998, 122-128); Marsaglia, MacLaren, and Bray (1964); and Walker (1977).

    rpoisson(m)
       Domain m:     1e-6 to 1e+11
       Range:        0 to 2^53-1
       Description:  returns Poisson(m) random variates, where m is the distribution mean.

                     Poisson variates are generated using the probability integral transform methods of
                     Kemp and Kemp (1990, 1991), as well as the method of Kachitvichyanukul (1982).

    rt(df)
       Domain df:    1 to 2^53-1
       Range:        c(mindouble) to c(maxdouble)
       Description:  returns Student's t random variates, where df is the degrees of freedom.

                     Student's t variates are generated using the method of Kinderman and Monahan (1977,
                     1980).
