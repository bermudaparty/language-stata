    tin(d1, d2)
       Description:  true if d1 < t < d2, where t is the time variable
                     previously tsset

                     You must have previously tsset the data to use tin().
                     When you tsset the data, you specify a time variable t,
                     and the format on t states how it is recorded.  You type
                     d1 and d2 according to that format.

                     If t has a %tc format, you could type tin(5jan1992
                     11:15, 14apr2002 12:25).

                     If t has a %td format, you could type tin(5jan1992,
                     14apr2002).

                     If t has a %tw format, you could type tin(1985w1,
                     2002w15).

                     If t has a %tm format, you could type tin(1985m1,
                     2002m4).

                     If t has a %tq format, you could type tin(1985q1,
                     2002q2).

                     If t has a %th format, you could type tin(1985h1,
                     2002h1).

                     If t has a %ty format, you could type tin(1985, 2002).

                     Otherwise, t is just a set of integers, and you could
                     type tin(12, 38).

                     The details of the %t format do not matter.  If your t
                     is formatted %tdnn/dd/yy so that 5jan1992 displays as
                     1/5/92, you would still type the date in day-month-year
                     order:  tin(5jan1992, 14apr2002).
       Domain d1:    date or time literals or strings recorded in units of t
                     previously tsset or blank to indicate no minimum date
       Domain d2:    date or time literals or strings recorded in units of t
                     previously tsset or blank to indicate no maximum date
       Range:        0 and 1, 1 means true

    twithin(d1, d2)
       Description:  true if d1 < t < d2, where t is the time variable
                     previously tsset

                     See the tin() function; twithin() is similar, except the
                     range is exclusive.
       Domain d1:    date or time literals or strings recorded in units of t
                     previously tsset or blank to indicate no minimum date
       Domain d2:    date or time literals or strings recorded in units of t
                     previously tsset or blank to indicate no maximum date
       Range:        0 and 1, 1 means true
