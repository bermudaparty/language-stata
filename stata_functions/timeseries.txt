    [D] functions -- Functions


Description

    This is a quick reference for the time-series functions.  See [TS] time series for an introduction
    to the time-series analysis commands.  See [D] datetime concerning date and time functions.  For
    help on all functions, see [D] functions.

    Stata also provides lag, lead, and difference operators; see [U] 11.4 varlists.


Selecting time spans

    tin(d1, d2)
       Domain d1:    data or time literals recorded in units of t previously tsset
       Domain d2:    data or time literals recorded in units of t previously tsset
       Range:        0 and 1, 1 means true
       Description:  true if d1 < t < d2, where t is the time variable previously tsset.

                     You must have previously tsset the data to use tin().  When you tsset the data, you
                     specify a time variable t, and the format on t states how it is recorded.  You type
                     d1 and d2 according to that format.

                     If t has a %tc format, you could type tin(5jan1992 11:15, 14apr2002 12:25).

                     If t has a %td format, you could type tin(5jan1992, 14apr2002).

                     If t has a %tw format, you could type tin(1985w1, 2002w15).

                     If t has a %tm format, you could type tin(1985m1, 2002m4).

                     If t has a %tq format, you could type tin(1985q1, 2002q2).

                     If t has a %th format, you could type tin(1985h1, 2002h1).

                     If t has a %ty format, you could type tin(1985, 2002).

                     Otherwise, t is just a set of integers, and you could type tin(12, 38).

                     The details of the %t format do not matter.  If your t is formatted %tdnn/dd/yy so
                     that 5jan1992 displays as 1/5/92, you would still type the date in day-month-year
                     order:  tin(5jan1992, 14apr2002).

    twithin(d1, d2)
       Domain d1:    date or time literals recorded in units of t previously tsset
       Domain d2:    date or time literals recorded in units of t previously tsset
       Range:        0 and 1, 1 means true
       Description:  true if d1 < t < d2, where t is the time variable previously tsset; see the tin()
                         function; twithin() is similar, except the range is exclusive.
