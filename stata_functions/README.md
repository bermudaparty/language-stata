These .txt files were copied from Stata's help viewer. To get to the same text, type `help functions` and then click on each of the possibilities. The parser is `regex.py` and the list of functions are held in `all_functions.txt`. This list was created with functions from Stata 15, but I may add other functions from Stata 14 and Stata 13 if I find many are missing from version 15.
