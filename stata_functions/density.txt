Beta and noncentral beta distributions

    betaden(a,b,x)
       Description:  the probability density of the beta distribution, where
                     a and b are shape parameters; 0 if x < 0 or x > 1
       Domain a:     1e-323 to 8e+307
       Domain b:     1e-323 to 8e+307
       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307; interesting domain is 0 < x < 1
       Range:        0 to 8e+307

    ibeta(a,b,x)
       Description:  the cumulative beta distribution with shape parameters a
                     and b; 0 if x < 0; 1 if x > 1

                     ibeta() returns the regularized incomplete beta
                     function, also known as the incomplete beta function
                     ratio.  The incomplete beta function without
                     regularization is given by
                     (gamma(a)*gamma(b)/gamma(a+b))*ibeta(a,b,x)
                     or, better when a or b might be large,
                     exp(lngamma(a)+lngamma(b)-lngamma(a+b))*ibeta(a,b,x).

                     Here is an example of the use of the regularized
                     incomplete beta function.  Although Stata has a
                     cumulative binomial function (see binomial()), the
                     probability that an event occurs k or fewer times in n
                     trials, when the probability of one event is p, can be
                     evaluated as cond(k==n,1,1-ibeta(k+1,n-k,p)).  The
                     reverse cumulative binomial (the probability that an
                     event occurs k or more times) can be evaluated as
                     cond(k==0,1,ibeta(k,n-k+1,p)).

       Domain b:     1e-10 to 1e+17
       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307; interesting domain is 0 < x < 1
       Range:        0 to 1

    ibetatail(a,b,x)
       Description:  the reverse cumulative (upper tail or survivor) beta
                     distribution with shape parameters a and b; 1 if x < 0;
                     0 if x > 1

                     ibetatail() is also known as the complement to the
                     incomplete beta function (ratio).
