       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Description:  returns the digamma() function.  This is the derivative of lngamma(x).

                     The digamma(x) function is sometimes called the psi function.

       Range:        0 to 8e+307

       Description:  returns the unique integer n such that n < x < n + 1.
                     returns x (not ".") if x is missing, meaning that floor(.a) = .a.

                     Also see ceil(x), int(x), and round(x).

    int(x)
       Domain:       -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Range:        integers in -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Description:  returns the integer obtained by truncating x toward 0; thus,

                     returns x (not ".") if x is missing, meaning that int(.a) = .a.

                     One way to obtain the closest integer to x is int(x+sign(x)/2), which simplifies to
                     int(x+0.5) for x > 0.  However, use of the round() function is preferred.  Also see
                     round(x), ceil(x), and floor(x).

    invcloglog(x)

       Description:  returns the inverse of the logit function of x,
                         invlogit(x) = exp(x)/{1 + exp(x)}.

       Range:        -744 to 709

       Domain:       integers 0 to 1e+305
       Range:        0 to 8e+307
       Description:  returns the natural log of n factorial = ln(n!).

                     To calculate n!, use round(exp(lnfactorial(n)),1) to ensure that the result is an
                     integer.  Logs of factorials are generally more useful than the factorials
                     themselves because of overflow problems.

    lngamma(x)
       Domain:       -2,147,483,648 to 1e+305 (excluding negative integers)
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Description:  returns the natural log of the gamma function of x.  For integer values of x > 0,
                         this is ln((x-1)!).

                     lngamma(x) for x < 0 returns a number such that exp(lngamma(x)) is equal to the
                     absolute value of the gamma function.  That is, lngamma(x) always returns a real
                     (not complex) result.

       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Description:  returns the maximum value of x1, x2, ..., xn.  Unless all arguments are missing,
                         missing values are ignored.
                         max(2,10,.,7) = 10
                         max(.,.,.) = .

       Domain xn:    -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Description:  returns the minimum value of x1, x2, ..., xn.  Unless all arguments are missing,
                         missing values are ignored.
                         min(2,10,.,7) = 2
                         min(.,.,.) = .

       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Domain y:     0 to 8e+307
       Range:        0 to 8e+307
       Description:  returns the modulus of x with respect to y.  mod(x,y) = x - y*int(x/y)
                         mod(x,0) = .

    reldif(x,y)
       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Domain y:     -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing
       Description:  returns the "relative" difference |x-y|/(|y|+1).
                     returns 0 if both arguments are the same type of extended missing value.
                     returns missing if only one argument is missing or if the two arguments are two
                         different types of missing.

    round(x,y) or round(x)
       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Domain y:     -8e+307 to 8e+307

       Description:  returns x rounded in units of y or x rounded to the nearest integer if the argument
                         y is omitted.

                     returns x (not ".") if x is missing, meaning that round(.a) = .a and round(.a,y) =
                         .a if y is not missing; if y is missing, "." is returned.

                     For y = 1, or with y omitted, this amounts to the closest integer to x;
                     round(5.2,1) is 5, as is round(4.8,1); round(-5.2,1) is -5, as is round(-4.8,1).
                     The rounding definition is generalized for y != 1.  With y = .01, for instance, x
                     is rounded to two decimal places; round(sqrt(2),.01) is 1.41. y may also be larger
                     than 1; round(28,5) is 30, which is 28 rounded to the closest multiple of 5.  For y
                     = 0, the function is defined as returning x unmodified.  Also see int(x), ceil(x),
                     and floor(x).

    sign(x)
       Domain:       -8e+307 to 8e+307 and missing

       Description:  returns the hyperbolic sine of x,
                         sinh(x) = {exp(x) - exp(-x)}/2.

                     contains the sum of the first through jth observations on x.  See [D] egen for an
                     alternative sum function, total(), that produces a constant equal to the overall
                     sum.

    tan(x)
       Domain:       -1e+18 to 1e+18
       Range:        -1e+17 to 1e+17 and missing
