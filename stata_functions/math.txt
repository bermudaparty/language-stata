                     ".") if x is missing, meaning that ceil(.a) = .a

                     Also see floor(x), int(x), and round(x).

    digamma(x)
       Description:  the digamma() function

                     This is the derivative of lngamma(x).  The digamma(x)
                     function is sometimes called the psi function.
       Domain:       -1e+15 to 8e+307
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing

    exp(x)
       Description:  the exponential function of e^x

                     This function is the inverse of ln(x).
       Domain:       -8e+307 to 709
       Range:        0 to 8e+307

    floor(x)
       Description:  the unique integer n such that n < x < n + 1; x (not
                     ".") if x is missing, meaning that floor(.a) = .a

                     Also see ceil(x), int(x), and round(x).
       Domain:       -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Range:        integers in -8e+307 to 8e+307

    int(x)
       Description:  the integer obtained by truncating x toward 0 (thus,
                     int(5.2) = 5 and int(-5.8) = -5); x (not ".") if x is
                     missing, meaning that int(.a) = .a

                     One way to obtain the closest integer to x is
                     int(x+sign(x)/2), which simplifies to int(x+0.5) for x >
                     0.  However, use of the round() function is preferred.
                     Also see round(x), ceil(x), and floor(x).
       Domain:       -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Range:        integers in -8e+307 to 8e+307

    invcloglog(x)
       Description:  the inverse of the complementary log-log function of x
                     invcloglog(x) = 1 - exp{-exp(x)}

       Range:        0 to 1 or missing

    invlogit(x)
       Description:  the inverse of the logit function of x
                     invlogit(x) = exp(x)/{1 + exp(x)}

    ln(x)
       Description:  the natural logarithm, ln(x)

                     This function is the inverse of exp(x).
       Domain:       1e-323 to 8e+307
       Range:        -744 to 709

    lnfactorial(n)
       Description:  the natural log of n factorial = ln(n!)

                     To calculate n!, use round(exp(lnfactorial(n)),1) to
                     ensure that the result is an integer.  Logs of
                     factorials are generally more useful than the factorials
                     themselves because of overflow problems.
       Domain:       integers 0 to 1e+305
       Range:        0 to 8e+307

    lngamma(x)
       Description:  the natural log of the gamma function of x

                     For integer values of x > 0, this is ln((x-1)!).

                     lngamma(x) for x < 0 returns a number such that
                     exp(lngamma(x)) is equal to the absolute value of the
                     gamma function.  That is, lngamma(x) always returns a
                     real (not complex) result.
       Domain:       -2,147,483,648 to 1e+305 (excluding negative integers)

                     logit(x) = ln{x/(1-x)}
       Domain:       0 to 1 (exclusive)
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing

    max(x1,x2,...,xn)
       Description:  the maximum value of x1, x2, ..., xn

                     Unless all arguments are missing, missing values are
                     ignored.
                     max(2,10,.,7) = 10
                     max(.,.,.) = .

    min(x1,x2,...,xn)
       Description:  the minimum value of x1, x2, ..., xn

                     Unless all arguments are missing, missing values are
                     ignored.
                     min(2,10,.,7) = 2
                     min(.,.,.) = .
       Domain x1:    -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing
       Domain x2:    -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing
       ...
       Domain xn:    -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing

    mod(x,y)
       Description:  the modulus of x with respect to y
                     mod(x,y) = x - y*floor(x/y)
                     mod(x,0) = .

       Domain y:     0 to 8e+307
       Range:        0 to 8e+307

    reldif(x,y)
       Description:  the "relative" difference |x-y|/(|y|+1); 0 if both
                     arguments are the same type of extended missing value;
                     missing if only one argument is missing or if the two
                     arguments are two different types of missing
       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing
       Domain y:     -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing

    round(x[,y])
       Description:  x rounded in units of y or x rounded to the nearest
                     integer if the argument y is omitted; x (not ".") if x
                     is missing (meaning that round(.a) = .a and that
                     round(.a,y) = .a if y is not missing) and if y is
                     missing, then "." is returned

                     For y = 1, or with y omitted, this amounts to the
                     closest integer to x; round(5.2,1) is 5, as is
                     round(4.8,1); round(-5.2,1) is -5, as is round(-4.8,1).
                     The rounding definition is generalized for y != 1.  With
                     y = 0.01, for instance, x is rounded to two decimal
                     places; round(sqrt(2),.01) is 1.41. y may also be larger
                     than 1; round(28,5) is 30, which is 28 rounded to the
                     closest multiple of 5.  For y = 0, the function is
                     defined as returning x unmodified.  Also see int(x),
                     ceil(x), and floor(x).
       Domain x:     -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Domain y:     -8e+307 to 8e+307
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307

    sign(x)
       Description:  the sign of x: -1 if x < 0, 0 if x = 0, 1 if x > 0, or
                     missing if x is missing
       Domain:       -8e+307 to 8e+307 or missing
       Range:        -1, 0, 1 or missing

       Range:        0 to 1e+154

    sum(x)
       Description:  the running sum of x, treating missing values as zero

                     For example, following the command generate y=sum(x),
                     the jth observation on y contains the sum of the first
                     through jth observations on x.  See [D] egen for an
                     alternative sum function, total(), that produces a
                     constant equal to the overall sum.
       Domain:       all real numbers or missing
       Range:        -8e+307 to 8e+307 (excluding missing)

    trigamma(x)
       Description:  the second derivative of lngamma(x)

                     The trigamma() function is the derivative of digamma(x).
       Domain:       -1e+15 to 8e+307
       Range:        0 to 8e+307 or missing

    trunc(x)
